Description: This R library is an R wrapper with added functionality (written by
    D. Zeleny) around twinspan.exe file. The source code for twinspan.exe is based
    on TWINSPAN algorithm introduced by Mark O. Hill; original FORTRAN code was
    compiled into twinspan.exe by Stephan M. Hennekens for the use with his program
    MEGATAB (part of Turboveg), with later added modifications by Petr Smilauer (for
    program JUICE, developed by Lubomir Tichy).
